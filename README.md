An app to get information about cat breeds from CatAPI and to keep track of most searched ones. It has a complementary api [here](https://github.com/sukcinitas/dc-cat-wiki-api).

This project helped me improve my skills in images, responsiveness and TypeScript.

- I can see the summaries of the most searched cat breeds on the homepage
- I can see the breed details including description, temperament, origin, life span, adaptability, affection level, child-friendly, grooming, intelligence, health issues, social needs, stranger friendly
- I can see more photos of the breed
- On mobile, when I select the search option, a modal for breed search should pop up
