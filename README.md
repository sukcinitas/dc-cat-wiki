An api to get information about cat breeds from CatAPI and to keep track of most searched ones. It has a complementary api [here](https://github.com/sukcinitas/dc-cat-wiki-api). You can find an application demo [here](https://cats-wiki.netlify.app/) (it might take a little while for server to wake up).
This project helped me improve working with images, responsiveness and TypeScript.
